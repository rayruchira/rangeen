In this project, the input image is enhanced in such a way that it helps people with CVD (Colour Vision Deficiency) to distinguish between colors such as red, green, orange, brown and yellow. This also allows the user to use a double left mouse click to find the RGB value at a point.

## Issues
- Improper tracking
- Changes in spots
- real time for only yellow
